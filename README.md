## Nodes

`Spectral Loader`: load spectral file, output `Spectral` object and preview image
`ENVI Loader`: load imagery with associated ENVI header files and reading & writing spectral libraries with ENVI headers. 


## WIP

- plot nodes
- k-means node
- pca node
- calculate nodes
- save node
- preprocess nodes
